Playcrafting is a game community that brings together programmers, artists, and designers in order to establish both 
networking opportuinties as well as learning opportunities. Founded in 2009, Playcrafting has expanded across several major
cities including New York, San Francisco, and Boston. The group offers many different types of activities in order to expose
gaming enthusiasts to the industry early on. Workshops and classes are offered multiple times each season to further 
comprehension of game development and program use. Playcrafting also holds bi-seasonal Game Demos, which was the event that I
attended on March 28th. It was held at the Microsoft Nerd Center and was overall a very causal networking event. The Demo was 
open to anyone interested in game development and the community was quite inviting. Upon arriving, all attendants traversed 
the room speaking to the various presenters who were stationed at tables. 

##The Forgettable Dungeon

The first game I demoed at Playcrafting was called "The Forgettable Dungeon", a pixelated, cooperational dungeon crawler that
was still in the early testing stages. Looking back, I was really glad to have started at this particular booth as it was 
a great representation of the working process in the game development industry. The game was funded via Kickstarter and the 
representative from Happy Box Games spoke to me about the features that still needed to be added, as "The Forgettable Dungeon"
is still a work in progress. Demoing the game was incredibly fun! The controls made a lot of sense. They had set up four game
controllers for attendants to use, so I played alongside two other people. Exploring the environment was quite enjoyable, 
especially after discovering that literally every object in the game, not just the randomly generated enemies, could be 
smashed to pieces. We quickly traversed the dungeons, but ended up finding multiple ways to break the game. Destroying certain
enemies too quickly would cause them to glitch out and give nearly infinite coins as a response. This proved to be one of the 
major problems that the game had that evening, as several playtesters found the same outcome. Overall, the game was a lot of
fun to play and although I look forward to playing it again upon completion, it still definitely needs a lot of work.

##Bacon Man

The next game that I playtested was entitled, "Bacon Man", a high difficulty platformer with the option of online co-op. 
I was originally drawn to this booth by the art style. The game was visually stunning with particularly good particle effects
and smooth animations. You play as "Bacon Man" and battle through different levels and environments in order to defeat enemies.
The storyline wasn't revealed during the playtest as Seth Mantie, the representive of Unreal Boston, only planned on demoing
the tutorial level and one difficult "fun level". The controls made a lot of sense and, thankfully, the tutorial level 
introduced all of the key movements in a very straightforward method. The "fun level", however, was quite a shift as the 
difficulty level spiked almost immediately. Seth mentioned multiple times that the game was designed to be exceptionally hard
to beat and it really made you feel proud to beat after dying so many times. The innocent looking art style contrasted heavily 
with the difficulty levels, which was both misleading and exciting. Although this game was near completion, it was a beta test 
that night, playtesters were able to find a few last minute glitches that needed to be fixed. If you're willing to 
put up with the incredible frustration when playing each level, the satisfaction of beating it overwhelming and completely
worth the effort... mostly. 

##Mondrian: Abstraction in Beauty

My favorite game of the night was entitled "Mondrian: Abstraction in Beauty". It was described as a "full circle" block
breaking game reminiscent of the classic style of "Pong". What was fascinating about the game was the hidden inspirations
behind the style. It was designed to be about video game art history, which I unfortunately didn't get to hear that much
about during the playtest. I'd be interested to hear and see more about where the art history comes in. Each level featured
a different type of paddle and a different puzzle shape each time as well. The gameplay was incredibly therapeutic as playing
required a good deal of focus to aim the ball, but also didn't require enough attention to make the game too difficult.
This game is out on Steam currently and was definitely the most complete game that I got to play at the Demo.

Meeting up with members of Lantana Games, the company that designed "Mondrian", was a wonderful networking experience. Lantana
Games is always looking to hire students who are looking to break into the game industry in Boston. They have a Lantana Law
which states that a single contribution on any game earns you one in-game credit. So one contribution puts your name on the
team and you can use it in a resume. 

##Conclusions

Overall, I'm very glad that I got to attend Playcrafting and would love to go to the next one as well. The entire night was a 
great networking opportunity as I got to meet a wide variety of members of the game industry and get a glimpse of the design
process in action. I plan on contacting Lantana Games in the near future to see what other opportunities the have for students!
